"""Single source of truth for trandom ST test cases.

Each case defines:
  - name:        case identifier, used as subdirectory name and by main.cpp kCases[].
  - dtype:       numpy dtype (e.g. np.uint32).
  - shape:       (rows, cols) — allocated tile dimensions for output.
  - valid_shape: (valid_rows, valid_cols) — effective computation region.
  - key_shape:   (2,) — shape for key (seed) input.
  - counter_shape: (4,) — shape for counter input.
  - eps:         tolerance for numpy.allclose (atol and rtol).

gen_data.py and compare.py both import this list to avoid redundant definitions.
